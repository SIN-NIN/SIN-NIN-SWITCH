briccmii v2 (19.06.2018)
Corrupts (or fixes) the first byte of every BCT's pubkey in BOOT0 so your Nintendo Switch always enters RCM mode (or boots normally)
Also checks (and restores) proper keyblob into customer_data of said BCT, if requested.

Usage
 Send the briccmii.bin to your Switch running in RCM mode via a fusee-launcher (sudo ./fusee-launcher.py briccmii.bin or just drag and drop it onto TegraRcmSmash.exe on Windows)
 Follow the on-screen prompts.
