   # Lockpick
    Lockpick is a ground-up C++17 rewrite of homebrew key derivation software, namely kezplez-nx. It also dumps titlekeys. This will dump all keys through *_key_05 on firmwares below 6.2.0 and through *_key_06 on 6.2.0.

    Due to key generation changes introduced in 7.0.0, Lockpick is not able to dump keys ending in 07 at all. Furthermore, unfortunately the public method to dump tsec_root_key is only available on firmware 6.2.0 so 7.x consoles can only dump through keys ending in 05.

   # What this software does differently
    Dumps titlekeys and SD seed
    Dumps all keys through 6.2.0
    
    Uses the superfast xxHash instead of sha256 when searching exefs for keys for a ~5x speed improvement
    
    Gets all possible keys from running process memory - this means no need to decrypt Package2 at all, let alone decompress KIPs
    
    Gets bis keys and header_key without tsec, sbk, master_key_00 or aes sources. Shoutout to exelix11 for using this method in SwitchThemeInjector! Homebrew devs should be doing this instead of requiring users to provide key files!
    Usage
    
    Use Hekate v4.5+ to dump TSEC and fuses:
    Push hekate payload bin using TegraRCMSmash/TegraRCMGUI/modchip/injector
    Using the VOL and Power buttons to navigate, select Console info...
    Select Print fuse info (not kfuse info)
    Press Power to save fuse info to SD card
    Select Print TSEC keys
    Press Power to save TSEC keys to SD card
    Launch CFW of choice
    Open Homebrew Menu
    Run Lockpick
    
    Use the resulting /switch/prod.keys file as needed and rename if required by any software you're using
    You may instead use biskeydump and dump to SD to get all keys prior to the 6.2.0 generation - all keys up to those ending in 05. Lockpick will dump all keys up to that point regardless which firmware it's run on.

   # Notes
    To get keys ending in 06, you must have firmware 6.2.0 installed
    No one knows package1_key_06, it's derived and erased fully within the encrypted TSEC payload. While there's a way to extricate tsec_root_key due to the way it's used, this is unfortunately not true of the package1 key
    If for some reason you dump TSEC keys on 6.2.0 and not fuses (secure_boot_key) you will still get everything except any of the package1 or keyblob keys (without secure_boot_key, you can't decrypt keyblobs and that's where package1 keys live)
   
  # Building
    
    Release built with libnx release v2.4.0. https://github.com/switchbrew/libnx

    Uses freetype which comes with switch-portlibs via devkitPro pacman:

    pacman -S libnx switch-portlibs
    then run:

        make
    
    to build.

    # Special Thanks
    
    tÃ¨snos! For making kezplez-nx, being an all-around cool and helpful person and open to my contributions, not to mention patient with my enthusiasm. kezplez taught me an absolute TON about homebrew.
    SciresM for hactool, containing to my knowledge the first public key derivation software, and for get_titlekeys.py
    roblabla for the original keys gist and for believing in our habilities
    The folks in the ReSwitched Discord server for answering my innumerable questions while researching this (and having such a useful chat backlog!)
    The memory reading code from jakibaki's sys-netcheat was super useful for getting keys out of running process memory
    The System Save dumping methodology from Adubbz' Compelled Disclosure
    Shouts out to fellow key derivers: shadowninja108 for HACGUI, Thealexbarney for Libhac, and rajkosto ðŸ‘€
    misson2000 for help with std::invoke to get the function timer working
    Simon for the eticket_rsa_kek derivation method and for suggesting invoking spl for faster titlekey derivation
    SciresM for the libnx aes library
    The constantly-improving docs on Switchbrew wiki and libnx
    Literally the friends I made along the way! I came to the scene late and I've still managed to meet some wonderful people :) Thanks for all the help testing, making suggestions, and cheerleading!
