# Starting documentation

  I suggest making documentation of the steps and process you take when you start your project with the tools and info. 

  I've provided you via my own Github Rep to enable you to do a simular or even es axact of a end result as possible which is 100% up to your own discretion on how you proceed of course. 

  But by doing so in a simular fashion with documentation and note taking each step you do and what road block happens when you need to see what was missed and why or you are stuck at a certain point to get past it or may even be sraight forward and you fly through it with no hassle.

  # Example.

  Device info gathering and resources needed to get the same end result specified as a requirement to complete each step correctly. and also either  understand what you just did to do it again successfully.
